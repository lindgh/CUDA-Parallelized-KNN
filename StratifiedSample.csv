1,Disappointed!,"This CD set is terrible! The sound quality is bad, its like someone taped it from the t.v. or radio. Its very tinny sounding and sounds far away on some songs. I can honestly say that there are about 2 songs that sound normal! Also on one side of the CD jacket where it usually tells about the band members its not in english so I do not know what it says. When I received the package in the mail it was in a bubble envelope with no packing slip and it had a persons name and address on it that was not from the place advertised to come from. The package label was computer generated,cut out by hand and not cut straight and on the top right hand side it said stamps.com! The signs were there that this was not right but this CD was the only one left and I love this band, the the other choice for this CD would be coming from Russia!! I contacted Amazon to tell them about my disappointment and had to fill out out a comment box and Amazon was going to forward my questions to the place I bought the CD from (the CD came from a third party) The third party emailed me  and  said that the address that the CD was mailed from was where the mail had always been sent from (Brooklyn) and that they don't know where I got that it was coming from Ohio! (Ohio was where the store was that i was to get the CD from). I feel like I have been suckered into buying something that was misrepresented! They also said that the CD was an import but was sent out sealed and was regular factory pressed. Do they have different quality standards in other countries?

No, but with so many good ones out there, I'd pass this one up, unless you are a slave for punishment.  In the year 2014, given all the progress mankind has made, at least regard to the distribution of GREAT PERFORMANCE ART, it is heinous that this performance is being foisted off on the public.

1,DON'T BOTHER!,"After spending more time analyzing this release I decided to revise my review to point out several other problems with it. First of all, they have chosen for the cover of this boxed set one of the most unflattering EARLY pictures of Rosemary I've ever seen (which appears to be from the 1940s) -- from a period that does not even seem to correspond to when these recordings were made (1955-61). How odd. Then they repeat that same rotten photo on all the CDs. The decision to do this is reflective of the rest of the package because it demonstrates that whomever it was (Robert Bader of Crosby enterprises?) who chose this repertoire for Mosaic, was fairly clueless about this great artist.<br /><br />Otherwise, why would they have made such a poor choice of repertoire? Once you've listened to the first disk, there's no reason to bother listening to the other four; they all sound the same. There is a monotony to the music that is stultifying. Typically a song starts out with Buddy Cole's hideous Hammond, Rosey sings a little, then we have to endure overly long bridges on which Mr. Cole tries to show off his keyboard skills on the electric organ, and then Clooney does a quick ending. On some songs it seems Cole is the star and Rosey just fills in here and there. It has been reported on the web that there were over 250 songs by Miss Clooney in the can from these radio shows. All sorts of her performances on the Bing/Rosey show and her own CBS broadcasts are missing. Understandably, since this set features roughly 100 songs they had to omit some. But it's the ones they left out that are among HER BEST. Where are ""My Personal Possession,"" ""Around the World,"" ""Colors,"" ""Tammy,"" ""It's Never Quite the Same,"" ""Almost In Your Arms."" The list goes on: GREAT SONGS that SHOULD have appeared here, but disappointingly do not. The numbers I mentioned would have imbued this offering with more musical diversity. Instead we get too many of the same-sounding songs.<br /><br />The statement that ""90 recordings - have never been available until this limited, collector's edition set"" is provably UNTRUE. You can find many of these songs on scores of OTR sites, some of them in very good fidelity, which have been sold on CD-Rs by the site owners (for only a few bucks) for YEARS and are the equal of what is on the Mosaic expensive set. Just browse the web if you don't believe me. Sadly, there are also some really bad copies of some wonderful Clooney performances that appear on the web and THOSE are the ones that Bader and Mosaic should have given us here. Why didn't they?<br /><br />The sound quality is not bad but it could be better. It is highly dubious these recordings are all derivative of tapes as is claimed. Why else would there be some pops and clicks, if some of these didn't come off disks?<br /><br />So we are left with a set that seems deliberately to spotlight the most bland recordings by Miss Clooney out of some stellar tracks that are known to exist. A barely passable pianist, when Buddy Cole turned to his hideous Hammond organ to accompany Clooney (or Bing Crosby), he invariably RUINED the track. He had a real knack for coming in blaringly LOUD and TOO FREQUENTLY, utterly destroying the mood of the song and stomping all over Rosemary's exquisite vocals. Granted there are a handful of songs on this VERY OVERPRICED set that have somehow escaped Cole's ruination, but not enough salvageable material to even make 1 decent CD out of. I know. I've tried to go through and pick out enough songs to burn a ""favorites CD"" for my own enjoyment. It's very hard. There are a few gems, but I emphasize the word FEW.<br /><br />Miss Clooney was a vastly underrated singer of considerable power and depth, whose beautiful intonation and perfect pitch were so very pleasurable to hear. It is a sad, sad thing that an opportunity was missed to showcase her lesser known performances here. Bottom line: don't bother. There is plenty of other wonderful Rosemary Clooney material available on Amazon.<br /><br />And BTW, despite the vicious personal assaults on me by other reviewers who even purport to know who I am (how could they?), I am not shilling for anybody else. What I have posted here is my honest opinion. I commend the label for wanting to do a package on one of the finest female singers of all time. I just wish they would have gotten the fans involved to help them pick the material. We could have recommended far better songs than what is showcased here. THAT is my point. I seriously doubt they will come out with a Vol. 2 boxed set anytime soon. It is just very disappointing to a lot of us Clooney fanatics. Her fans DESERVE to hear the rest of her unreleased music and many of us will never live long enough to enjoy that pleasure.",[],B00M3D0CN2,B00M3D0CN2,AGIO22QCA6V3TSIIM5YNITCX3WOQ,1407342825000,16,TRUE,2014

1,Taras Bulba hits the bargain basement,"I've acquired the key elements of this excellent Waxman score on several compilation albums recorded within the past 20 years, the longest of which is a 10+ minute suite; all of these little suites are performed beautifully and in magnificent sound.<br />THIS recording may be the original but it is in mono (they DID have Stereo in 1962) and if Hallmark (a/k/a Pickwick) didn't bother to get the stereo masters and lifted it off a mono LP or tape, either way, it's hardly acceptable. There was nothing done to remaster or improve the flat, mono sound. It has no resonance. The artwork is redundant (front, back, inlay) and it's a no frills affair redeemed only by the magnificent music of Waxman. Based on this release and some lackluster vintage pop releases from Hallmark with similar sound issues, I will avoid the label. I can't believe the other reviewers of Taras had no bone to pick about the sound, unless they're listening to it on an alarm clock CD player. This is a sound-stage orchestra, not a trio. Let someone re-issue classic soundtracks who cares and knows how. FYI...there was a newly recorded complete score of Taras issued recently, but I was the fool who saved a couple of bucks because I preferred to have the original.

1,All the Good Reviews Look Fake - This is Junk,"This is really junk junk.  Normally I read reviews, but I was in a rush and only looked at stars.  Now after I got the hose and tried it out and saw how bad it was I went back to read the reviews.  The only good reviews were written by people who are from the seller and who have  been given a &#34;discounted&#34; (I assume free) hose to test and give an &#34;unbiased&#34; report on it.  All the bad reports were given by innocent people like me that trusted the stars.  I thought Amazon had solved this problem of fake reviews.<br /><br />Anyway, the nozzle did not attach properly to the hose because the threads don't match up so it leaked badly.  This problem is compounded by the fact that the nozzle once attached cannot be removed because the nozzle threads onto a fitting that has a separate set of threads in the back which thread directly to the hose.  So when you try to remove the nozzle you end up unthreading the valve that the nozzle threads into.  There is no place to put a wrench on to keep everything from spinning. It is hard to describe, but trust me you can't remove the nozzle.<br /><br />The holder is a thin piece of metal with no holes to put screws in so it can be mounted.<br /><br />So I am returning it as you will too if you buy it.  I never actually got to see how long the hose lasts.  I refer you to the other one star reviews for that information.

2,Technically poor recording,"Klara Wurtz’s playing of the complete Mozart piano sonatas, when compared to those recorded by Friedrich Gulda (with a Boesendorfer Imperial) in 1982 on audio tape and then restored to a certain level by Deutsche Grammophone, can be deemed very good; however, the work done by the recording engineer on these CDs is only poor and degrades that very good performance of Ms. Wurtz. This could also be due to the place (a caf&eacute; in Utrecht) where the sonatas were recorded. Recording solo piano is one of the most demanding jobs in the world, these CDs sound like they are recorded on cassette tapes, lacking any clarity and details, and the enormous reverberation effects due to the recording place also gives the sound a foggy nature. I would like to direct the classical piano lovers to an example on how solo piano can be recorded in a superb way:  “Pianist: Dubravka Tomsic, A Liszt Recital, IPO Recordings, Inc.” Please be warned that after you have a chance to hear (of course “not” listening to it with a handheld electronic gadget or through a computer) how actually the classical piano must be recorded as exemplified by the above CD, you may never go back and listen to your once favorite piano CDs, because 99.9% of those solo piano CDs we purchase with high hopes only came out to be recorded in a mediocre manner, by using sub par microphones and microphone placement techniques. To my opinion, Klara Wurtz should sit once again and record the complete sonatas with a more professional recording engineer in a professionally-checked hall; the world is in need of hearing such excellent pianists through better recorded CDs.",[],B003AO1L06,B003AO1L06,AGSCX3O3YVMJK2TPYRNPZOBJFTJQ,1376102825000,4,TRUE,2013

It's not my favorite in the world, but it does get a listen more times than not.<br /><br />I can't say the same about this CD, ""Seraiah.""  It's a disappointment.  Whereas their previous work was clearly Glam/Slick Metal a la Crue (and, perhaps, Slaughter?), this seems to me to be a shift in a more ""Hard Rock"" direction.  I ***HATE*** it when supposedly Metal bands go in the bluesy, crooner direction.  But, then: Maybe, playing Heavy Metal for Christ was never in Seraiah's plan, anyways; maybe, they were just a Motley Crue clone following the trends in order to get a record deal.  Unfortunately, there is nothing of distinction on this disk: The choruses are weak -- although, that could have been a production problem; the ballad at the end of the disk is saccharine and unmemorable.  There's nothing on this disk that would make one want to bang his head or turn up the radio.  Nothing.<br /><br />I'll keep ""Carnival World"" as a memory of what was and could have been.

2,"Lovely light classics, but is this a long-lost treasure trove?","This affordable set is full of compelling performances, from an era when ordinary GIs were readily beguiled by symphonic music, although the sound quality and volume level are both variable in this reissue package. The sequence here is somewhat random, including two selections from LA BOHEME in glaringly backwards order. Worse, the documentation is minimal, with misspelled titles and without record numbers, dates, or even composers' names. Among other technical glitches, the reissue engineer gives us a misguided pause in the music wherever the limited playing time of the 78-rpm V-Discs necessitated a side break in the middle of a selection.<br /><br />(Record historians will note that V-Disc technicians squeezed more grooves onto each inch of disc surface than conventional records would hold at the time. It is startling to discover V-Disc record sides here running up to 7 minutes, roughly 50 percent longer than each side of a 12-inch record issued for household use in the mid '40s. Within a few years after the war, the &#34;nonbreakable&#34; vinyl compounds developed for V-Discs were being adapted for commercial record issues, yet the idea of longer-playing 78s generally remained alien to major-label producers.)<br /><br />In this compilation, the problem is NOT that we are not always hearing Toscanini but that we are not consistently hearing V-Discs. All of these recordings apparently do represent Toscanini's conducting, even if quite a few of them are clearly pirated from other record reissues, especially when we reach the third and fourth CDs in the set. Some of the same performances may have appeared in the V-Disc format, but a number of them did not.<br /><br />So, for example, we hear two movements from Beethoven symphonies, as acoustically recorded with the touring La Scala Orchestra way back in 1920 and 1921, plus four out of five movements from Grofé’s Grand Canyon Suite, only two of which appeared on a V-Disc. (Heaven knows why the CD producers chose to omit one movement from Toscanini's well-known interpretation while including the overture to LA FORZA DEL DESTINO twice, without explanation, evidently treating us to the same performance as heard on a somewhat distorted V-Disc and later as heard on another label's cleaned-up transfer.) There is also a Scherzo from A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM that sounds as if it has been pirated from a re-equalized CD copy of Toscanini's 1929 recording with the Philharmonic-Symphony Orchestra of New York.<br /><br />Thus, ironically, both the oldest, worst-sounding recordings and all of the best-sounding recordings are unmistakably copied from other CDs published by competing companies, not from &#34;original acetates&#34; as claimed. Perhaps this kind of chicanery helps explain why no record numbers are provided.<br /><br />In this context, I'm afraid, another listener's list of the maestro's V-Discs compounds the confusion, because it is NOT complete. Toscanini's recording of Smetana's Moldau, for instance, did appear on V-Disc 121 (some pressings say 113), and it is reproduced in this album, as is Rossini's overture to IL SIGNOR BRUSCHINO (V-Disc 637B). Meanwhile, as the list correctly reminds us, some of the most interesting Toscanini selections that were issued on V-Discs—particularly Don Gillis’s Symphony 5½ and a chorus-and-orchestra suite from Paul Dukas’s ARIANE ET BARBE-BLEUE—are conspicuously absent from the CD set.<br /><br />More broadly, if this appears to be a treasure trove of otherwise unpublished performances, it isn't. Toscanini did not make records specifically for the Armed Forces' V-Disc program, although a few Toscanini issues in this series did have special spoken introductions. With few exceptions, his V-Disc issues were extracted from regularly scheduled NBC Symphony Orchestra concert broadcasts of 1940s vintage, some of which later appeared on the RCA label, while On the Beautiful Blue Danube was transferred to V-Disc from a commercially available RCA Victor record. As a result, nearly all of the performances dubbed from actual V-Discs in this set are now available elsewhere with far better sound quality (closer to the first-generation source discs).<br /><br />After all the complaining is done, it must be admitted that most of the musical repertoire in this set is delightful, including a few forgotten miniature gems such as Overture to a Fairy Tale (after A Midsummer Night's Dream), by Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco, and Novelletta, by Giuseppe Martucci. Whether the purchaser wants to assemble this material by collecting more expensive CD issues is obviously a matter of personal priorities. Without question, the set does remind us how readily Toscanini could elevate &#34;light classics&#34; to the status of high art.",[],B00637M7SW,B00637M7SW,AGHPLGVHAMW4U74WZ6KB5YJMWN5A,1473546791000,1,TRUE,2016

2,Reminds me of early '70s pre-CCM albums by Oral Roberts University World Action Singers,"Walmart Associates Choir, THE EYES OF A CHILD, CD.<br /><br />Sound on this CD bin stuffer very closely follows something like old pop Christian (Light Records) Oral Roberts University World Action Singers, pop star and son Richard Roberts & wife Patti Roberts, c. 1970 or so--CCM pre-Amy Grant.  Pre-Evie Tornquist.  Think Pat Boone Family CCM albums (pre-Debbie Boone, too), Jesus pop by Evangelical groups in matching orange & purple 100% polyster tuxedos and gowns, ""wholesome family entertainment"" Christian music for the early '70s.  Being a schlock music enthusiast (Elvis soundtracks, song poems, Rodd Keith, David Hasselhoff '80s dance rock, phony rock groups during the Nixon administration, Mormon disco synth-pop, etc...), I had to check this release out.  It looked excruciating.  No, bland, yes; excruciating, no.<br /><br />Liner notes state that a ""Verl Mason"" was the musical giant behind this.  This set is also contributing towards the Children's Miracle Network, mentioning that it's connected to Marie Osmond in some way.  Hearing it, I thought it sounded very much like late '70s and '80s Mormon youth pop music groups on vinyl sold via the Deseret Book chain and LDS Stake Center bookstores; however, though the sound is very much like that vanilla wholesome youth music, I managed to find references to ""Verl Mason"" as Verl Lee Mason, a Christian choir director and keyboardist known for Christian music and beauty pageant pop music backing tracks around the Kansas City, Missouri area.  His recording history is fairly shallow, but goes back to some local indie music 45s in the early '80s on the Fifth Street Records label, CR-1061, ""That All Over Look Is You""/""We Should Be Together"" by Carla Ladd.  Stylistically, Verl Mason's music has a lot in common with Ralph Carmichael's sound on those early '70s Oral Roberts singers' albums on the Light record label.<br /><br />Admittedly a bizarre music release, but a milquetoast listening experience that belies the hype.",[],B019UFENB2,B019UFENB2,AEFLICXXHRBMNT4HAZH2NUU6TCOA,1547372032421,1,TRUE,2019

2,Inexpensive but Flawed,"A company called ""Real Gone Jazz"" released four volumes of Les Baxter music (32 complete albums) and the sound quality ranged from terrible to very good.  By terrible, I mean that some of the albums had skips and surface noise as you would find on a worn record.<br /><br />This company, the ""Documents"" label, seems to be using many of the same sources, as the occasional static splotch or record skip occurs at the same exact moments on the same exact tracks.  At first glance, a one-to-one comparison between the ""Real Gone Jazz"" release and this ""Documents"" release  may give the sound edge to the ""Documents"" Milestone collection, as the recording is louder, and it gives the impression of being brighter and less compressed.  But this may be part illusion.  In many cases, if you just turn up the speaker volume on the ""Real Gone Jazz"" release, you would get sound close to the ""Documents"" release sold here.  Additionally, this release seems to accentuate flaws, and any defects in the source album are highlighted.  Finally, this release is too shrill in places, bringing out distortion in denser passages.<br /><br />Note:  If you are mainly interested in Baxter's Africa/South America/etc. exotica sound, by all means find a copy of the out-of-print ""Exotic Moods of Les Baxter"" collection.  I's a sampler of many of Baxter's albums, but sound is very good and there are no obvious flaws like record skips.<br /><br />The ""Documents"" Milestone collection pairs 2 complete albums on 10 CDs for a total of 20 albums.  Each CD is in a cardboard sleeve, and it is difficult to remove a CD without getting fingerprints on it.  The 10 sleeves fit in a cardboard box.  There is no documentation beyond a few paragraphs on the back of the cardboard box.<br /><br />Sound varies, so see below:<br /><br />CD1: The absolute classic ""Ritual of the Savage""  has good sound overall, but the tracks ""Quiet Village"", ""Coronation"", and ""Love Dance"" have 1 or 2 minor defects each.  (These are the same exact glitches on the Real Gone Jazz set, but other productions have found sources without these flaws.)  These defects are typically a ""micro-skip,"" like a quarter-second skip ahead.  They are noticeable if you know the music or are just paying attention, but they might slip by if it's just on in the background.  The other album is ""Festival of the Gnomes.""  It may be conducted by Baxter, but it is otherwise classical ballet-like music written by Prince Di Candriano.  Not what Baxter is known for, and my least favorite album in this collection.  Sound is mainly fair, but bright.<br /><br />CD2:  ""Thinking of You"" is easy listening, though the arrangements are often creative.  The sound is good with no flawed tracks.  It is paired with ""The Passions"", an album that has to be heard to be believed.  Vocalist Bas Sheva sings, grunts, and screams thoughout.  The last track, ""Joy"", is worth the price of admission.  Sound is good, but can get too bright or shrill.<br /><br />CD3:  ""Kaleidoscope"" is more easy listening than exotica.  Sound is generally OK to good.  Only ""April in Portugal"" had 2 minor defects, but some album dust is apparent now and again on other tracks, but nothing that would distract a typical listener.  The other album is ""Caribbean Moonlight"".  Defects, such as micro-skips, can be heard on ""Taboo"", ""The Breeze and I"", and ""Nightingale"".  No deal-breakers, just momentary irritations.  The record source seems obvious.<br /><br />CD4:  ""La Femme"" is easy-listening composed by Baxter.  Relaxing enough to guide you to sleep.  The terrible, muddy sound on the Real Gone Jazz set is improved upon here to a fair sound, but this is achieved with the introduction of significant hiss.  Unfortunately, the other album ""Round the World"" (just as on the Real Gone Jazz set) is repeatedly mangled with micro-skips and record pops.  Only the last three tracks, I believe, come out unscathed.  This is the low point of the set.<br /><br />CD 5:  ""Skins"" is a concept album.  It is entirely percussion music, mostly all of it composed by Baxter.  No melody, just ambiance, but that's OK.  Sound is pretty good except for a layer of hiss that might become more apparent at louder playing levels.  The album it is paired with, ""Midnight on the Cliffs"" is problematic.  Several tracks are marred with volume drops, moderate clunks from a scratch as a record spins around, record dust, and/or flat-out skips.  ""Take My Love"", ""Unchained Melody"", ""Suddenly"", and ""When You're in Love"" had significant problems.<br /><br />CD6:  The first album is the famous ""Space Escapade"" with its futuristic exotica.  The recording is a bit bright, with an occasional shrillness in the violins.  ""South Pacific"" follows and is a step down.  There's more intrusive album noise including some buzzing on a few tracks, album dust, one track with a warble, and one sudden spitting static sound.<br /><br />CD7:  The easy-listening ""Love is a Fabulous Thing"" starts out roughly, with an oscillation to the sound volume which might indicate a warped record source.  The first track is the worst and then it gets better over the next 3 tracks or so.  Otherwise, there is album dust sound and some distortion.  The fantastic ""African Jazz"" album is quite enjoyable, but you'll notice a buzzing distortion at times in louder and denser passages.  This is Baxter at his best.<br /><br />CD8:  The first album is ""Wild Guitars"" and is made up of creative covers.  The sound is pretty good, except that distortion can be heard here and there - nothing serious, but a layer of buzz at times during denser passages.  The film score ""Goliath and the Barbarians"" follows.  The brightness helps at times, but again, there is just a bit of distortion that occurs every so often.  Not noticeable unless you're really listening.  This type of audio issue is certainly more preferable to the album dust and skips we were hearing earlier in the set.<br /><br />CD9:  ""Teen Drums"" starts us off.  As you might expect, there is lots of percussion, but other instruments are featured throughout.  It may be the best sounding recording on the entire set.  It is paired with ""Young Pops"" which is definitely in the easy-listening category.  The record source is evident now and again, and there is some distortion.  The only flaw which might really bother you, though, is a glitch on ""Summer Place"" which sounds like a skip.  (Again, it's the same skip on the ""Real Gone Jazz"" release.)<br /><br />CD10:  The delightful record ""Jewels of the Sea"" start off us, and this is a relaxing and melodic album.  The record source is obvious and there is hiss and a few light pops.  There's a sort of oscillating reverb that is more obvious on some tracks than others, but this might be part of the original concept.  The film score ""Master of the World"" ends the collection.  Sound is bright, but can get harsh and start to distort at times.  No flaws like skips, though.",[],B071HJHZLC,B071HJHZLC,AGIPA7TKBLREBRI4UO5L3QKQY73Q,1569114970359,10,TRUE,2019

So far, I don't find it all that memorable or catchy. The guitar work is pretty sweet and melodic, but nothing is getting me super psyched. This may be because, although Lindberg is the vocalist, he is not the lyricist, and that makes a big difference to me. I love his vocals AND his lyrics. A similar case is found on the lone The Crown album he is on: Crowned In Terror, which I prefer to this Nightrage offering. On that The Crown album, Lindberg writes the lyrics for a few songs, which I find to be my favorite songs.<br />If, like me, you are a Lindberg fan, I highly, HIGHLY recommend Live The Storm by Disfear.

It's surprising given that she had a number of strong albums earlier.

It justified buying the album for me at least. It's the only track that channeled whatever magic was present in the past.<br /><br />Fire & Snow has a unbearable reggae-influenced cover of Prince's &#34;When 2 R In Love&#34;.

Unfortunately they are so old that they sound terrible and I know they will soon break. Plus, when the cassette player stops it makes a racket and wakes him up.<br />He likes these Classical Lullabies ok, but not as much as the tapes.

Inside is a cd, dvd, and photobook with many of the same pictures from the Korean Sherlock photoshoot, but also some outtake shoots and some MV stills.

Unless you have a region-free dvd player, you probably won't be able to watch the DVD (region 3), but it is the photobook that really shines here. The pictures are all promotional shoots from the video and they are GORGEOUS. Versace and Chanel dressed and accessories give the girls a softer, more romantic look that perfectly match the tone of the single and remind Blackjacks why these women are queens. Worth the money if you can get it for a decent price.",[],B008DQ3GR2,B008DQ3GR2,AEOQJRWI4LJVBBHNYLRU6NBYN2FA,1417189813000,1,TRUE,2014

4,Well done meditation/ hypnosis....,"I've studied and practiced hypnosis.  I've listened to many different kinds of guided meditations and subliminal ones.<br />  The guided meditation here is simple, yet very well done.  To me, it's as much about increasing one's self-esteem as<br />attracting love. Since those two things, combine in a easy way, because when one feel's self-confident it's much more likely<br />to attract love.<br />  What this meditation has which many others lack, the woman's voice is sincere and tonally  pleasing.  There is a consistent volume,<br />so it's easier to stay in a meditative state. The suggestions are stated in positive fashion. There's no distracting music(on one side).<br />  It's common knowledge that hypnosis/meditation is a tool, to help one DO something, they WANT to do.  So there's no<br />miracles, but this is a good tool to add to your love 'toolbox'.  On the subliminal side, the first track is a clearly audible review of<br />what the subliminal  suggestions are, so you know what the 'program' is. The other two subliminal tracks are music blended with<br />ocean/ water sounds.",[],1564702324,1564702324,AFUUOBP64KFMH26PHENRQZN6J4AQ,1425151148000,3,TRUE,2015

4,"Obscure gem (and he can act, too!)","This guy is a prolific character actor I get a kick out of watching whenever he pops up unexpectedly in a role...and you've likely never heard of him.  But you've seen him and said, &#34;Hey, it's THAT guy again. What's his name, anyway?&#34;  His name is Darin Heames.  Get familiar.<br /><br />Anyway, when I found out 18 years after-the-fact that he'd put out a CD I had to snag a copy, and I'm really glad I did.  It's a mellow, interesting mix of country-tinged blues, jazz, storytelling, and even a nice turn with the Native American flute.  He's got a good tenor and knows his way around the fretboard of a guitar.  But this ain't ear candy.  These songs mean something.<br /><br />The devastating &#34;Johnny Walker Red&#34; is the standout track for me, accurately portraying the desolation of being an addict in recovery, wanting to use, but knowing what will happen if you do.  &#34;Witching Hour&#34; is evocative of the Southwest, what with the vocal harmony and the flute, takes me right back to the long, dark highway between Flagstaff AZ and the Rez that I drove many a time when I lived there.  &#34;Streetwalker&#34; is a snaky little jazz half sung/half spoken number that tells the sad story of Cindy, a young hopeful who lands in Hollywood with big dreams and no way to make them happen.  The title track and &#34;Broken Man&#34; explore life from the point of view of the homeless and down-on-their-luck, however they ended up there,  &#34;Shadowland&#34; is just...haunting.  There's more, but you'll just have to get your own copy and give it a listen.<br /><br />I didn't give it 5 stars because the percussion's a bit shallow - I'm thinking that's a production problem.  Other than that relatively minor issue, this is really good CD.  If you can score a copy, do it.  Highly recommended.",[],B000K06K3G,B000K06K3G,AGGTBDOH3QFWDPH5ISOUQ7I4A2IQ,1449988730000,0,TRUE,2015

4,Another classic Rush release but slightly flawed,"I'm not going to gush over the album - if you're a fan, you know how awesome it is and if you're just getting into Rush, this is a solid album to own. As with some of the other reviews, my primary complaint is the live material.  Disc two consists of the Pinkpop performance from 1979. That's all fine and good but the extra bonus live material is 2112 from Arizona 1978 - which an entire live recording exists of in pro recorded quality...so why not include that as a complete performance as was done with A Farewell To Kings? A definite missed opportunity and for those interested in seeking the recording out, it's readily available online and has the following track listing:<br /><br />Storm Over Tucson 7/20/78<br />High quality soundboard/broadcast<br /><br />Anthem<br /><br />A Passage To Bangkok<br /><br />By-Tor & The Snow Dog<br /><br />Xanadu<br /><br />Something For Nothing<br /><br />The Trees<br /><br />Cygnus X-1<br /><br />Hemispheres<br />(missing a small section about 3/4 of the way through - my guess is whoever did the taping came to the end of the reel and had to change to a new one quickly and missed this part - typical of 70s recordings using reel to reel recorders but also perfectly dating it and flashing those of us back that were there)<br /><br />Closer To The Heart<br /><br />Circumstances<br /><br />A Farewell To Kings<br /><br />La Villa Strangiato<br /><br />2112<br /><br />Working Man /Bastille Day/In The Mood/Professor on Drums",[],B07HQ7L9QB,B07HQ7L9QB,AFSNJWW4CESACPHASXM77DSTO5HQ,1544054179252,13,TRUE,2018

Aside from some minor surface noise from the swirl vinyl, it's a great sounding release, even for a single vinyl edition.

I thought I was getting a double LP and was initially disappointed but after multiple listens doing an A-B with the other pressing, I prefer this one by far. The drums are more clear and out front and the mid range is dialed back significantly.

4,FINALLY!,"I grew up with this recording.  I know the old mono set with Von Karajan conducting for EMI from about the same time period is still the standard, has more blood and thunder in its performance and is more authentic when sung in its mother German. &#34;Hansel and Gretel&#34;  was the first opera to be recorded in complete form by the Metropolitan Opera for Columbia records in the late 1940's and was first issued on 78's (Which obviously served as the basis for this transfer) and came in two volumes.  It was issued in LP form and was available for decades.  Because it is so historic and because still holds such an important place in my childhood memories it is hard for me to be objective about it. I still have two (count 'em two) sets of the LP's which I still listen to. In any event it is a joy to have this recording on CD,  The sound is certainly passable. There are NO liner notes just the barest information of the cast in German which is comical as it is sung in English using the old Constance Bache translation.<br /><br />Of course the larger question is why Columbia hasn't seen fit to issue this performance on CD themselves?  They are the keepers of the source material.  They have already reissued the majority of the recordings they went on to do with The Met on CD. Considering this was the first collaboration and also knowing the length of time this recording was in the catalogue it's restoration and return on CD is badly needed.  Columbia should take this release as the cue that it is and start digging!",[],B076K2RPJ8,B076K2RPJ8,AGDPY5FB773RCY24UBRPECF25YYQ,1528538255184,2,TRUE,2018

5,"Welcome back, Bozo!","This was a 2 record, 4 song collection that I remember from my childhood.  I believe the set was issued from the late 40's on<br />78rpm and thru the 50's on 45rpm.  I still had these records until the last few years - I gave them to another family member who<br />misplaced them.  My siblings and I played these and other children's songs for many years on countless record players.<br />The tunes are catchy with first rate Capitol Records production.  If I had our original set, I'm sure they would sound like<br />bacon frying in a sandstorm.  These records and cover were in very good condition - what child takes good care of records?!<br />I play these songs and others from my childhood for my grandchildren and extended family and they are enjoyed as much or<br />more than the current children recordings.<br />The purchase was quick and easy.  The seller was quite prompt with the shipment.  This was a very pleasant experience!",[],B009KBR9BI,B009KBR9BI,AFTPY5TSJ3OTKRQ7HMCLHKG57BPQ,1373859783000,0,TRUE,2013
